# Dynamic Web Practice

This project is a practice exercise for dynamic web development using JavaScript objects, `Math.random`, and loops.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web content. By leveraging objects, `Math.random` for randomness, and loops for iteration, we aim to build a web application that showcases the power of these fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Features

- **Object-oriented Approach:** Utilizing JavaScript objects to model and organize data for a more structured and modular codebase.

- **Randomness with `Math.random`:** Introducing randomness to create dynamic and unpredictable elements within the web application.

- **Loops for Iteration:** Implementing loops to efficiently iterate over data structures, perform repetitive tasks, and dynamically generate content.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ricwolf19/JS-Travel-Sale.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to experience the dynamic web content.

## Usage

Explore the web application to see how JavaScript objects, `Math.random`, and loops come together to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
